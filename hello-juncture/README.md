# Fengshen yanyi Character Portraits: 1695 and 1895

The original Shu Zaiyang edition of the novel, published in the early 1600s, does not have individual character portraits, only a single illustration for each chapter. The earliest known edition of *Fengshen yanyi* with individual character portraits appears to be the 1695 Shan cheng tang edition, which only has the portraits in the preface of the book and no chapter illustrations.

The illustrations in the 1895 Hongwen shuju edition is likely based on the 1891 Guangbaisongzhai edition, and, like the 1891 edition, feature both character portraits and chapter illustrations.

Below are a comparison of Nezha's character portraits in the 1695 and 1895 edition, as well as a short iconographic analysis.

This image is an woodblock print character portrait of Nezha in the 1695 edition of *Fengshen yanyi*. Here, he is depicted as a youth wearing Dudou and Yingluo necklace, who wields a spear and stands on twin flaming wheels.

The image comes from the scan of Book 1-10 of *Xiu xiang feng shen yan yi*, hosted on [Digitale Sammlungen Ostasien](https://ostasien.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb11129917?page=38,39).

A highly similar design is found in the late Qing* Fengshen zhenxing tu*, a ink drawing collection consisting entirely of *Fengshen yanyi* character portraits, labelled as "Shancai Tongzi Nezha", which may suggest a conflation between Nezha and *Journey to the West*'s Red Boy in both 1695 edition and the later work.

This image is a print portrait of Nezha from the 1895 edition of *Fengshen yanyi*. A "Cloud Shoulder" (Yunjian) accessory made of lotus leaves is worn around his shoulders, which may be the result of opera costume infleunces. His magical sash is tied around his waist like a belt, and he wields both a spear and his iconic Qiankun Ring.
