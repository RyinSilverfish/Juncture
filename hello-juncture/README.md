# Fengshen yanyi Character Portraits: 1695 and 1895

The original Shu Zaiyang edition of the novel, published in the early 1600s, does not have individual character portraits, only a single illustration for each chapter. The earliest known edition of *Fengshen yanyi* with individual character portraits appears to be the 1695 Shan cheng tang edition, which only has the portraits in the preface of the book and no chapter illustrations.

The illustrations in the 1895 Hongwen shuju edition is likely based on the 1891 Guangbaisongzhai edition, and, like the 1891 edition, feature both character portraits and chapter illustrations.

Below are Nezha's depictions in the Shu Zaiyang edition, followed by a comparison of Nezha's character portraits in the 1695 and 1895 edition.

## Earlier Context: Nezha in the Shu Zaiyang Edition illustrations

Because the Shu Zaiyang Edition does not have individual character portraits, I have taken partial screenshots of Nezha's design in the chapter illustrations, using the PDF scan from the [National Archives of Japan](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/img/4216020). 

Because each page of the PDF features two illustrations, I will label the individual illustration on the page with "Left Panel" and "Right Panel".

This is Nezha's earliest cameo in Chapter 12, prior to his death and Lotus Body Resurrection. (p. 24 of the PDF, right panel)

![Nezha in the Shu Edition, Chapter 14](https://ryinsilverfish.github.io/media/NezhaChapter14.png)

Nezha right after the Lotus Resurrection, chasing Li Jing down in Chapter 14. (p. 25 of the PDF, right panel )

![Nezha in the Shu Edition, Chapter 33](https://ryinsilverfish.github.io/media/NezhaChapter33.png)

Nezha re-enters the story in Chapter 33 to rescue Huang Feihu and his family. From here on, this design will be most consistently used for him in the illustrations. (p. 34 of the PDF, left panel)

![Nezha in the Shu Edition, Chapter 79](https://ryinsilverfish.github.io/media/NezhaChapter79.png)

Nezha in his new Three-headed, Eight-armed Form. In-story, he receives the transformation ability from his master Taiyi in Chapter 76, but the design appears in the Chapter 79 illustration.

## *Xiu xiang feng shen yan yi*, 1695, Shan cheng tang edition

![Nezha Portrait in the 1695 Edition](https://api.digitale-sammlungen.de/iiif/image/v2/bsb11129917_00038/full/full/0/default.jpg) 

This image is an wood engraving print character portrait of Nezha in the 1695 edition of *Fengshen yanyi*. Here, he is depicted as a youth wearing Dudou and Yingluo necklace, who wields a spear and stands on twin flaming wheels.

The image comes from the scan of Book 1-10 of *Xiu xiang feng shen yan yi*, hosted on [Digitale Sammlungen Ostasien](https://ostasien.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb11129917?page=38,39).

A highly similar design is found in the late Qing* Fengshen zhenxing tu*, a ink drawing collection consisting entirely of *Fengshen yanyi* character portraits, labelled as "Shancai Tongzi Nezha", which may suggest a conflation between Nezha and *Journey to the West*'s Red Boy in both 1695 edition and the later work.

## *Zenxiang quantu Fengshen yanyi*, 1895, Hongwen shuju edition

![Nezha Portrait in the 1895 Edition](https://ryinsilverfish.github.io/media/Nezha1895.jpg)

This image is a print portrait of Nezha from the 1895 edition of *Fengshen yanyi*. A "Cloud Shoulder" (Yunjian) accessory made of lotus leaves is worn around his shoulders, which may be the result of opera costume infleunces. His magical sash is tied around his waist like a belt, and he wields both a spear and his iconic Qiankun Ring.

## Analysis

Overall, the twin hair buns and Wind-Fire Wheels from the Ming illustrations have been inherited by the two subsequent character portraits. However, the 1695 edition illustration seems to take more inspiration from the traditional depiction of Shancai/Sudhana, an acolyte of Guanyin who also inspires the Red Boy character in *Journey to the West*. As a result, the design incorporates jewelry and floating sashes that are more commonly seen on Buddhist deities, compared to the highly Daoist-ized Nezha of *Fengshen yanyi*

In contrast to both the Ming illustrations and the 1695 portrait, the 1895 edition takes more inspiration from opera costume than folk deity iconography, and may be the earliest design where Nezha's clothes have a lotus motif. Perhaps the different choices in character designs reflects the medium through which the novel's story was most commonly received by a popular audience?
